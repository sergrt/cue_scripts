# cue_scripts

Couple of handy scripts to manipulate CUE files in large music collections
I use foobar2000 and filter music collection by *.cue files. So there are some issues if no such files are provided.

- generate_cue.py - search for folders without cue files, and generates basic files
- replace_wav_flac.py - some sources provide cue files with WAV extensions instead of FLAC. This script will fix it
